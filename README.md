# 🔍 YouTube Search API - ML Model Deployment on AWS (FastAPI + Docker + ECS)

This project demonstrates how to **deploy a Machine Learning (ML) solution on AWS** using FastAPI, Docker, and Amazon ECS (Elastic Container Service). The deployed API performs semantic search using a model from [SentenceTransformers](https://www.sbert.net/), allowing for fast and accurate text-based querying.

---

## 🚀 Project Highlights

- ✅ ML model wrapped in a FastAPI-based RESTful API
- ✅ Dockerized for portability and ease of deployment
- ✅ Hosted on **AWS ECS with Fargate**, a serverless compute engine
- ✅ Docker image pushed to DockerHub for seamless cloud integration
